# Look into the past

April 27, 2020

**Task:** *We've captured a snapshot of a computer, but it seems the user was able to encrypt a file before we got to it. Can you figure out what they encrypted?*

In my opinion, this was one of the most interesting challences of this CTF as it was a mix of a few different sub-challenges to solve.

We were given a snapshop of a computer, in .tar format. After downloading it, we extracted its content:
```console
root@kali:~/introseccon# tar xvf look_into_the_past.tar 
```

Sure enough, the archive contained a computer snapshot with most usual directories that we find on linux hosts:

```console
root@kali:~/introseccon# ll look_into_the_past
total 80
drwxr-xr-x 20 bob  bob  4096 Feb  8 11:24 .
drwxr-xr-x  6 root root 4096 Apr 30 02:07 ..

```

Given the title of the challenge "Look into the past", we first thought that we should go check the logs, in /var/log but that directory was empty. So the next interesting place to check out was the /home/ directory.

Bingo!

```console
root@kali:~/introseccon/look_into_the_past/home/User# ll
total 52
drwxr-xr-x 9 bob bob 4096 Feb  8 11:24 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 bob bob 4096 Feb  8 11:24 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 bob bob  349 Feb  6 13:33 .bash_history

-rw-r--r-- 1 bob bob  672 Feb  6 13:34 .profile
drwxr-xr-x 2 bob bob 4096 Feb  8 11:24 Public
drwxr-xr-x 2 bob bob 4096 Feb  8 11:24 Videos
-rw-r--r-- 1 bob bob   37 Feb  6 13:33 .vimrc
```

We went through all of these folders and found that only **Documents** and **Pictures** were of interest.

## Documents

```console
root@kali:~/introseccon/look_into_the_past/home/User# ll Documents/
total 16
drwxr-xr-x 2 bob bob 4096 Feb  8 11:52 .
drwxr-xr-x 9 bob bob 4096 Feb  8 11:24 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 bob bob   48 Feb  8 11:50 flag.txt.enc
-rw-r--r-- 1 bob bob   48 Feb  6 13:33 libssl-flag.txt.enc
root@kali:~/introseccon/look_into_the_past/home/User# 
```

Hurray! There's our flag! Ok, so, obviously it's encoded and they're not going to make it easy for us to read that file.
Using the `File` command, we learned that it was openssl encoded:

```console
root@kali:~/introseccon/look_into_the_past/home/User/Documents# file flag.txt.enc 
flag.txt.enc: openssl enc'd data with salted password
```
