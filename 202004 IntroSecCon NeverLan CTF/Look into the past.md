Task:
We've captured a snapshot of a computer, but it seems the user was able to encrypt a file before we got to it. Can you figure out what they encrypted?

In my opinion, this was one of the most interesting challences of this CTF as it was a mix of a few different sub-challenges to solve.

We were given a snapshop of a computer, in .tar format:
`dfdfdfd.tar`
