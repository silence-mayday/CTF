# Look into the past

April 27, 2020

*Task:

We've captured a snapshot of a computer, but it seems the user was able to encrypt a file before we got to it. Can you figure out what they encrypted?*

In my opinion, this was one of the most interesting challences of this CTF as it was a mix of a few different sub-challenges to solve.

We were given a snapshop of a computer, in .tar format. After downloading it, we extract its content:
```bash
root@kali:~/Downloads/introseccon# tar xvf look_into_the_past.tar 
```

Sure enough, the archive contained a computer snapshot with most usual folders that we find on linux hosts:

```
root@kali:~/Downloads/introseccon# ll look_into_the_past
total 80

Given the title of the challenge "Look into the past", I first thought that I would go check the logs,
